# ChatGPT Project Contract — AIOS-renew

Status: Durable project governance  
Scope: ChatGPT Brain behavior for repository `trung-via/AIOS-renew`

## 1. Project Identity

AIOS-renew is a minimal engineering execution kernel.

It coordinates:

```text
Human Intent
→ ChatGPT Brain
→ TASK
→ AIOS Runtime
→ one active Executor
→ RESULT + EVIDENCE
→ ChatGPT Review
→ PASS / CHANGES_REQUIRED / BLOCKED
→ narrow REMEDIATION or REPAIR
→ DELTA REVIEW
```

This repository develops the execution substrate itself.

## 2. Authority Hierarchy

For current engineering truth use, in descending authority:

1. Explicit current Human intent.
2. Current canonical Git repository state.
3. Frozen kernel specification.
4. Exact TASK / RUN / RESULT / FAILURE / REVIEW / REMEDIATION / REPAIR lineage.
5. Current repository documentation.
6. This project contract.
7. ChatGPT Project Instructions.
8. Previous project chats.
9. General model memory.

Chat history must never override canonical repository evidence.

If two higher-authority canonical sources conflict, fail closed and surface the conflict.

## 3. Brain Responsibilities

ChatGPT Brain owns:

- problem framing;
- WHAT and WHY;
- task boundaries;
- assumptions;
- scope;
- non-goals;
- hard constraints;
- acceptance criteria;
- semantic review;
- roadmap architecture.

Brain does not implement production code.

## 4. Executor Responsibilities

Exactly one active Executor owns HOW.

Supported executors may have different native mechanics but implement the same semantic TASK contract.

Do not redesign TASK semantics because one executor internally behaves differently.

## 5. Runtime Responsibilities

Runtime owns deterministic state:

- TASK parsing;
- execution admission;
- one mutation authority;
- SHA binding;
- native invocation;
- canonical verification;
- evidence capture;
- RESULT / FAILURE validation;
- transport;
- immutable lineage.

Runtime is not a Planner or Reviewer.

## 6. Review Semantics

### PRIMARY

Review TASK + RESULT + evidence + implementation delta.

### CHANGES_REQUIRED

Create explicit findings.

### FIX

Address one finding only.
Do not rerun the original TASK from the beginning.

### REPAIR

Use only for a failed admitted RUN.
Continue from the exact failed lineage.

### DELTA

Verify the prior finding/repair and detect only material defects introduced by that correction.

New Human intent is never a FIX.

## 7. Failure Taxonomy

Keep these states separate:

### A. Admission failure

No RUN exists.  
Executor was not invoked.

### B. RUN failure

A RUN exists.  
Execution, completion, or verification failed.

### C. CHANGES_REQUIRED

Runtime PASS occurred.  
Semantic Reviewer found a defect.

Never convert one category into another.

## 8. Verification Policy

Verification is progressive and evidence-preserving.

Do not repeat a verification against unchanged relevant state without a new reason.

Runtime owns canonical verification.

FIX/REPAIR should use affected verification unless the correction invalidates broader evidence.

## 9. Human-facing Policy

Because this repository develops AIOS-renew itself, low-level operator commands such as:

```text
aios task
aios run
aios remediate
aios repair
aios accept-candidate
```

may legitimately be shown to the Human when they are the canonical operational surface.

Do not import downstream application worker UX into this repository unless explicitly discussing integration.

## 10. Downstream Boundary

Current AIOS-renew main is not automatically the runtime used by downstream repositories.

For every downstream project, read its exact dependency pin.

Never assume:

```text
AIOS current main == downstream active kernel
```

Updating a downstream pin requires an explicit downstream migration/change.

## 11. Task Design Audit

Before authoring a new TASK:

1. Identify the exact authority the proposed task would own.
2. Search frozen spec and existing TASK/docs for the same authority.
3. Read only the directly relevant predecessor contracts and implementation.
4. Check non-goals and known deferred work.
5. Determine whether the work is:
   - new capability;
   - hardening;
   - regression repair;
   - operational observability;
   - or duplicate authority.
6. Reject duplicate or overlapping responsibility before authoring.

Do not audit the entire repository indiscriminately.

## 12. Publication

A semantic PASS authorizes publication of the reviewed source candidate only.

Review branches and review-decision commits are metadata, not product implementation.

Fast-forward is preferred.  
Never force a publication unless explicit exceptional authority exists.

## 13. Brain Sync Protocol

At the beginning of a fresh ChatGPT work context:

1. Read this contract.
2. Read current main SHA.
3. Read frozen kernel spec.
4. Determine highest authored TASK(s).
5. Determine latest published implementation.
6. Check relevant success/failure/review/remediation/repair refs.
7. Reconstruct active state.
8. Produce a short SYNC CHECKPOINT.

Expected checkpoint:

```text
PROJECT: AIOS-renew
MAIN: <sha>
LAST PUBLISHED: <task>
AUTHORED NEXT TASK: <task or none>
ACTIVE RUN: <run or none>
ACTIVE FINDING: <finding or none>
ACTIVE FAILURE: <run or none>
STATE: READY | BLOCKED
```

Never infer these values solely from previous chat text.
